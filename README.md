# Summary
Created an iOS(Swift) application that displays information received over the network.  
This application receives information on events and displays display the name, city, state, and end date 


# Improvements

1. For bigger app, I would add ObjectMapper framework to make it easier to map and read code 
2. I would add Result framework to be able to bubble up service and network errors to the UI
3. Finish adding tests for the cell and viewController
4. Add header to collectionView to display nicely under the status bar
5. Do some auto resizing on the collectionView cell height
6. Modify cell so each cell shows as a better entity i.e. like a frame or border
6. For bigger app, I would add another layer between service and viewcontroller for business logic and accessing service. 
UI should not know anything about which service or how data is being manipulated
